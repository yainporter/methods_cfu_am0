# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
I am proud that I got this work done early! I have been working hard on my time management and not procrastinating because I know that it will play an important part in my success at Turing.
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
The power of using methods in our applications is the reusability of them. Instead of having to write a long code over and over again, we can call methods instead.
